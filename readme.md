A few small projects created in Python.

1. Dictionary - A whole dictionary data was read from a json file and then is used to produce results for searched words.
          It also gives suggestion for nearest possible match for word typed wrong.

2. World Map - It uses Pandas to read data like volcano location or population from json/txt file.
          Later Folium is used to use all that data nad plot on world map.

3. Website Blocker - A very basic program that adds specific website in 'hosts' file in system that are needed to be blocked during mentioned period of time.
          It adds and removes names of website that we want blocked during a time interval.

4. Website - A basic website built using Folium.
